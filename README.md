# AlternativeFramework
After feeling comfortable with the stack I have explored through school (C#, ASP Core, SQL), I wanted a chance to explore some of the frameworks and stacks that I was unfamiliar with and are also popular and well received by the developers. After a lot of reading, I decided to go with the Javascript, Node, and Postgres stack. Nodeâ€™s React library for the front-end development, Express for the backend, and Postgres for the database. I also explored hosting on google cloud. This stack seems to be paired well together because they all use the same language, making it easy to transition between front and backend.
